The skeleton project contains the base portlet files and ant scripts necessary to generate a new portlet project. This project is an attempt to remove the mundane grunt work necessary in the creation of a new Vignette portlet.

The following are auto generated:
Basic portlet directory structure
Configuration files necessary for deployment
A base portlet bean, view, and form
A base portlet view.jsp
